1. I created  index.html ans css files.

2. Then I have applied some grunt plugins to my app..
    that are : autoprefixer,watch,copy,cssmin,imagemin,connect

3. If you make any changes in index.html file it will reflect on browser when you refresh page.

4. If you make any changes in css files then save it, it will automatically compile by using grunt watch.

5. Displayed the output of index.html file on browser using connect grunt plugin.
